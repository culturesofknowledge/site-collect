Get up and running
==================

A list of things you'll need to get the EMLO web-form up and running

These notes are for opensuse but it should be obvious how to switch them over (zypper==apt-get)

You'll need a postgres and mongo database:
docker pull mongo
docker pull postgres

# You'll need some dev files
zypper in nodejs-devel		# On Ubuntu possibly: apt-get install nodejs-dev
zypper in postgresql-devel

# Install this one to global
sudo npm install sql-generate@0.3.0 -g

# Install modules
npm install # ignore warniong about sql-generate

# Setup which config (choose in config/config.js or create a new one)
export NODE_ENV='development'

# run it
node server.js
